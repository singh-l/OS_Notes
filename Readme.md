### How to implement syscalls in xv6

- This is my take on how syscall works in xv6 and how you should implement one. All these are hypothesis from the experiments I did:
  - The function exposed to the user is in `user.h` (say `my_syscall`)
  - `usys.S` tells the OS which function calls to make into a system call, so this has to be the same as the function exposed to the user (`SYSCALL(my_syscall)`)
  - When compiling, the OS looks in `syscall.h` for getting the syscall number for it. It looks for the value of `SYS_my_syscall` which is `#define`d. The `SYS` appended is probably for convention.
  - In `syscall.c`, this number is mapped to a function which will be used to extract arguments to the syscall from the stack and perform checks on them. We can call this function anything (say `getargs_my_syscall`). If we followed convention, we would've named it `sys_my_syscall` but you know I like breaking rules.
  - We'll define the function in a separate file `sysfile.c`, so we'll `extern` the function `getargs_my_syscall`. Note that since we don't know the arguments yet, this function will take no arguments. The linker links the object files of `sysfile.c` and `syscall.c` (We tell it to do that in the `Makefile`), so everything works out.
  - `getargs_my_syscall` will get the arguments and call the implementation of this syscall (say `implement_my_syscall`). Again we could've named it anything! This function will take the same arguments we gave `my_syscall` (if you write `getargs_my_syscall` correctly that is).
  - The function definition of `implement_my_syscall` is to be placed in `defs.h` so that `sysfile.c` can find it.
  - Implement `implement_my_syscall`
  - Make proper changes to `Makefile` for proper compilation.
  - Also note that the return value is integer always. It is usually used to test whether the syscall was successful or not. If you want to set a variable using the syscall, send a pointer to it as a parameter and then set that in the function.
  
- **Note: ** xv6 does not have `free`, so generally avoid using `malloc` since memory leaks. See `umalloc` rather.

- [`malloc()` v/s `sbrk()` v/s `brk()`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19676688/how-malloc-and-sbrk-works-in-unix)

- `malloc()` is a C library function and not a system call.
